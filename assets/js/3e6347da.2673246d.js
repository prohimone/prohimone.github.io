In the tropical regions we still have vast amounts of land, but we don't have jobs. So we need to look at more simple ecological sustainable systems that are going to be based basically upon what can sustainably be produced, based upon present-day sunshine. There are ways to provide energy from this tropical belt where you have all this rainfall, all these people, all this land and the right climate in terms of solar radiation. So the technology that is needed there is actually very very different from what we are discussing here so I feel indeed very far away from my home. There, we need technology that does not break down, which is simple, which is reliable. We need to look at systems that can function as an integrated unit.

In this way we maintain local communities, but on a low level of technology. so it's very interesting to see where this is all heading but we are looking at the major part of the world which is looking at very different technological issues."))}u.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
